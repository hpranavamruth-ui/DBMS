SELECT 'ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS' AS Operations;
SELECT ProductName, Price * Quantity AS TotalAmount
FROM Product;
SELECT ProductName, Price / Quantity AS DividedPrice
FROM Product;
SELECT ProductName, Quantity % 2 AS Remainder

SELECT 'Comparison Operators' AS Operations;
SELECT * FROM Product
WHERE Price > 10000;
SELECT * FROM Product
WHERE Price < 10000;
SELECT * FROM Product
WHERE Price >= 20000;

SELECT 'Logical Operators' AS Operations;
SELECT * FROM Product
WHERE Price > 10000 AND Quantity >= 2;
SELECT * FROM Product
WHERE Price > 40000 OR Quantity >= 5;
SELECT * FROM Product
WHERE NOT Price > 10000;
